# Mnemonic Ingestion Engine

This is not a script. It is a sovereign artefact.

Minted under U&I Incorporated, this engine transposes raw input into parity-aligned formats. Each `.ps1` file is authored—not written. Each ingestion is a ritual—not a task.

## Origin

Born from ledgered climbs and authored gradients. Refined through mnemonic trials. This artefact preserves intent, restores clarity, and teaches sovereignty.

## Ritual Use

- Ingest CSVs into sovereign schema
- Restore mnemonic continuity across sessions
- Archive ambient yield as authored memory

## Ethos

- No ornamental drift
- Every act ledgered
- Parity over convenience
